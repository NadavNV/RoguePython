## General Information
Built on the foundation of the fantastic tutorial at [Roguelike Tutorials](https://rogueliketutorials.com/), I am 
adjusting the game and adding features to it, for my own enjoyment, experience, and learning.

The plan is to add an RPG system with player classes, various abilities and items, and an instanced, turn-based combat 
system similar to classic JRPGs.
## Technologies Used
* Python 3.12.2
* python-tcod 16.2.2
